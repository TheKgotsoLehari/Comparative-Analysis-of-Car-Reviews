    "2. Additionally, you want to investigate whether the satisfaction rate for the Honda Accord has improved from 2008 to 2009. To answer this question, you will also need to analyze the dataset `2008_honda_accord`, which consists of customer reviews for the Honda Accord from the year 2008.\n",

    "- a) Obtain the number of comments given in all four reviews and report the results.\n",

    "- c) During the cleaning process, you also need to remove numbers and HTML tags e.g. `<DOC>, <TEXT>, <AUTHOR>` and similar elements.\n",
    "- d)  The first two questions can be solved using sentiment analysis techniques.\n",
    "- e) Create appropriate `wordcloud`s for each part to visualize the most frequent words in the reviews.\n",
    "- f) Determine the optimal value of $k$ from the set $\\{2, 3, 4, 5\\}$ in Question 3.\n",
    "- g) (_optional_) Feel free to obtain any other relevant outputs, such as evaluation metrics or additional plots.\n",
    "- h) (_optional_) If you find that the algorithm used in Question 3 does not provide satisfactory performance, you can try incorporating the datasets `2008_honda_accord` and `2009_honda_accord` to cluster the reviews again, aiming for better results."

You get used to it really quick though, it took me a few days. The layout and solid build of this car great, although it could use a little more soundproofing in the wheels wells, when a rock flings up or you are driving in rain it is a little noisy. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase\n",

      "Before buying the Accord, I test drove the Altima & Camry. The Camry was very comfortable, but not sporty and the ride was boring. The Altima was sporty, but I chose the Accord over it because it?s a bit larger, and the EX trim had all the options I wanted. I was planning to get the 3.5 L V-6 engine, but after test driving the 4-cylinder (190 HP), I was very content with the pickup! So I saved $2 K upfront and will also save down the road since the 4 cylinder gets slightly better gas mileage. It?s a great car, spacious, comfortable, fun to drive, and handles very well. I would suggest opting for the body side moldings to help prevent door dings.\n",

User friendly interior design. Cons- Doors seem light and flimsy when you shut them. Some small, but annoying rattles when you drive. New brakes squeak when slowing down. The VCM (Variable cylinder management) seems to lurch forward when the Economy mode kicks in and out of operation. Overall a great car. It's a Honda.

The ride is firm but not harsh, It is more comfortable than the Maxima and looks much better than any Camry. Road noise is a little loud, but with a 270 watt stereo who cares! Looks good, rides good, has all the bells and whistles, and Honda dependable, what more can ask for under $25G.\n",

      "I just traded in My Suburban 2007 LT for the Accord. The inside of the Honda is a bit disappointing to me because it is cheap looking, it reminds me of Honda's I drove in the late 80's and 90's. I previously owned a Chrysler 300 2006, so it is difficult going from a real comfortable interior, really massive dash to a bland and old fashioned interior. My husband really wanted the Accord. Of course we didn't like putting over $100.00 worth of gas into the truck. My accord doesn't run smoothly, you can feel every bump and hear it loudly. Exterior looks good. I have over 6 foot tall boys (13,15) the leg room is barely enough. If you get migraines like me the gauge lights are bright white Yuk!\n",

A car is designed to use most of the front brakes to stop, almost 70% vs 30% rear. So whats the real problem. Honda's excuse is BULL, (NORMAL) My guess is that the rear emergency brake was never adjusted right from the factory thus inside pad wearing faster than the outside. Either way this is not normal and should be a defect and replaced by the factory. I drive 50K a year and had to replace the rears at 30K while the front had 11/32 left. For those that don't know 11/32 is new 2/32 in the min you should drive with. 11/32nd's show very little brake use at 50K. \n",

I thought I could just turn up the stereo to drown out the Accord's notorious road noise. Boy was I wrong. The premium sound system is below par any other standard sound systems I've had in any of my previous low end models (various makes). I took the car back to the dealership and was told there was nothing that could be done, this was the premium system and there are no upgrades available. \n",

      "When I first purchased the Accord in the fall of 2007, I gave it a glowing review, noting that Accord had a perfect balance of quality, value and sportiness. After nearly a year of ownership, the car seems to be getting long in the tooth. Yes, it is roomy, has a nice interior, silky smooth engine, good transmission and direct steering. Yet, the Accord seems to lack that spark posessed by its predecessor. From the hard and uncomfortable driver seat, excessive body roll, several rattles in the interior and intrusive road noise, the vehicle just does not strike a chord (n.p.i) with me. In fact, I find my 2006 Civic Ex w/Nav to be a better built, more comfortable and more engaging car. \n",

The headlights flicker every 16 seconds, making the drive stressful and tiresome. This flickering makes it harder to focus on the obstacle head.

This isn't the sticker MPG, it's from careful recording and calc. after filling up. Your break-in period for the first 600 miles is crucial - don't gun your engine during that time.

I do miss the auto- stick a lot, but it was a small trade off +'s for the Honda: more for the money: leather, sunroof, 87 OCTANE, Michelins, ipod support, warranty and service costs\n",

The engine provides enough power for my daily routine. It has a comfortable ride and most controls are logical, but the location of the volume knobs takes some getting used to. Also, it's fairly agile. However, I do have a few complaints. The dash board curves and sticks out when trying to get in. Therefore, both I and front seat passengers have banged our knees while getting in. Also, for a $20,000 car, Honda should have had Maintenance Minder standard.

Corners flatter than old Accord, although it seems a little slower, despite the bump in hp. The seats are very firm, but getting used to this. Fit and finish seems very nice so far. The stereo is not great, despite the specs, and I will probably change the rear speakers, which are mediocre. Back seat is expansive, great for three growing kids, one of the real plusses of this car. The stick is very smooth, and this really allows one to appreciate the vtec engine.

With the price of gas going to over $3.00 per gallon I wanted something more fuel efficient but large enough to seat four adults comfortably and provide a sense of safety too. Honda always provided a quality product for the money so I drove a Civic EX sedan, the Accord EX sedan, and a CR-V. The Civic was too small. The CR-V's engine felt like it needed more horsepower. The Accord was quiet, was easy to drive, seemed to be the right size, and would provide decent mileage. First two tankfulls delivered 20 MPG. Somewhat less than I was expecting but 33% better than the Pilot. I have the car on a three year lease and am pleased with it.\n",

Suspension is improved significantly almost matching German cars as well as the overall drive quality in the new Accord. Much better handling and solid feel on the road. However I have few complaints about the interior. Although the dash looks really high tech, quality of the material used is not even matching my 05 Accord coupe. Some of the buttons make a cracky noise when pushed. It is the same for aluminum looking trim on door handles. These make the same kind of noise when door is pulled also look cheap.

The acceleration for the 190 h.p is very good and the steering is nicely weighted. The ride though is very stiff and the leather driver's seat is even stiffer. I have a 37 mile one way drive to work and it is annoying trying to find a comfortable seating position. Honda please isolate the road noises luckily it has a good radio to try and drown out the LOUD road noise. I think higher profile tires might soften and quiet the ride...MAYBE!! I'll need the high resale value on the trade in SOON!!</TEXT>\n",

Road noise can be solved with different tires such as the Bridgestone Turanza Serenity tires that I have on my 04. They are extremely quiet! However front seat comfort is another story. There is too little cushioning and the side bolsters are too extreme! The driver's seat is a bit better because of the 8- way power adjustment which allows the seat cushion itself to be raised or lowered and angled flat if need be. The passenger seat with just a 4-way adjustment does not allow this. Honda needs to immediately fix this problem with an 8-way power passenger seat.</TEXT>\n",

Yes, I see what everyone means. I did end up buying a $12 seat cushion from Walmart that has made a difference. Seats aren't the best for long drives. Second, the \"ECO\" function, with switching from 6 to 4 cylinders is a little annoying as well. You have to learn how to optimize the accelerator pedal to minimize this. Navigation not as good as Lexus RX350, but I'm still learning it. Voice recognition not all that. Otherwise, I like the car, the look. It's not a sports car, but I'm pretty happy with it.</TEXT>\n",

For a mid-sized sedan, the Accord feels larger than any other car I had looked at in its price range and has a high quality build finish comparable to BMW. For real world use, the car performs well on any road, with study handling. I like the look and feel of the interior, but like other reviewers have found that it is easy to scratch & the controls do take a little getting used to; especially if you've not driven a Honda rec. There is plenty of room and storage areas throughout. </TEXT>\n",

      "<TEXT>I have owned this Accord for 7 months and overall it's a very nice car. The interior is roomy, plenty of shoulder and leg room. The ride and handling are crisp with a bit of European flavor to it, though it falls just short of the total experience. The sound system is OK but tends to be shrill at times. Gas mileage has been acceptable but not particularly notable. The seats are firm, and at first I didn't care for them, but after a while I learned to appreciate that the firmness is really part of the overall ride and handling and you feel more attuned and attached to the driving experience. Acceleration is middling but OK. Smooth and almost transparent shifting. Great car for commuting. </TEXT>\n",

We got the standard for one last \"hooraw\" before we qualify for AARP.

The steering wheel does not have a comfortable spot for my large hands. Is fun to drive around town but lacks power when you step on it.

Not only have I detailed a number of options missing that the competitors offer, but numerous problems have reared their ugly head in the past year. The 09 Sonata is a nice car, but it's priced right where it should be. After my year experience with the car, I understand why Hyundai does not have the resale value of the Japanese as well.

Comfort, size, safety... all excellent. Not quite as \"sporty\" as the Accord, but more luxurious... so it's a price I gladly pay.

We test drove a base Sonata with an option package and we weren't totally adverse to the experience, but we didn't like the interior fabric, the paint color, or the cheapo wheels. The dealer was running a sale this particular day, it was also coincidentally the end of the month and it turns out that's a very good time to buy a new car. I found a silver blue metallic Sonata Limited with the four cylinder and they had a sale price on it of $21,699. Wow, I thought. This is a nice car. In conjunction with $2,000 customer cash from Hyundai, we paid $2,225 less than invoice. Good negotiators might still beat that price.</TEXT>\n",

But when we noted the small difference in price between the Elantra and the 2009 Sonata after discounts, we decided on the Sonata because of its roominess and stated difference of only one fewer mile per gallon highway. No mistake! This car is comfortable, quiet, and the most pleasurable car to drive I've ever experienced other than something really high priced. And even then, the difference is marginal.

      "<TEXT>I just took delivery and am pleased thus far. The interior upgrades (esp. The dash) are vastly improved. Getting about 29 mpg so far. I personally wouldn't spend the monies on the v6 as the upgraded motor has plenty and the throttle response is 'right there' when giving it gas. Also why we bought is the increased seat width and more spacious cabin. We were looking at a 06-07 Nissan altima, but found the 4 cylinder to be noisy when shifting through gears. Plus the altima is priced 5-6k more. The fit and finish is tight and the ride is very quiet and smooth! Only thing missing is the tight steering response. I'll write more when I can get it away from my wife and finally drive it!</TEXT>\n",

I also own a Mercedes-Benz and can say that this Hyundai's suspension is remarkably comparable (never thought I would say that). Also, the transmission shifts much smoother than the earlier edition. There's also a more robust engine which delivers oomph when you touch the pedal. Cabin noise has been reduced substantially, as compared with earlier. INTERIOR: They finally got the interior right! It looks like, and may very well be, a high end car now! Color combination in the Camel interior is beautiful. Dash is remarkable!</TEXT>\n",

Once this got to around 12,000 miles, the fuel economy was almost unbelievable. Now averaging over 30mpg with set @ 75mph!! Handling is great. Seats are really comfortable. If there's better performance coupled with fuel economy in a V6 with 250 hp, I'd be surprised. We bought this over the Accord, Camary and Malibu and so for have NO regrets at all!!</TEXT>\n",

The greatest two things are : (i) size: even with he front seat entirely back the people in the back have ample space; (ii) the engine: the \"little\" 2.4 is a real joy: because of the manual upshift, you can really beat most of the other traffic. In town, the car gets 20 mpg. But highway, I easily get better than 35 mpg. The fifth gear picks up very well and moves smoothly from low rpm to high rpm.

Especially like the addition of the USB port for IPODS or IPHONES, it works very well. Only downside is the noise the engine makes at idle. It has a ticking sound, which goes away once you get the car past idle. This sound is not heard inside car unless door or windows are open.

The 2.4 has good power, but performance of the 5 speed automatic leaves a bit to be desired. Hyundai engineers failed in \"coordinating\" the transmission gearing and/or final drive and/or cruise control sensor. Climbing any incline over a couple of degrees at 60 mph or so will surely result in downshift from 5th to 4th (an increase of 900 rpm) when some downshifting is not at all necessary, or only a 5th gear \"shift\" to clutch/slippage (an increase of only 300-400 rpm) in 5th gear would be sufficient -- though still 'busy'.

      "<TEXT>My 2009 Corolla LE has about 23000 miles on it and steers great and handles great. That wasn't always the case. The car used to steer like the front was toed in. The problem issues were that the car was out of alignment in the rear and the Goodyear Eagle tires. The rear axle of an LE is a \"stamped axle\" and has no alignment adjustment. I had to have an alignment shop modify the rear axle bolt position to bring the car into a correct factory assignment. Once that was done the car steers as you would expect and it gained about 2 miles per gallon in fuel economy. I also replaced the Goodyear Eagle tires which are not safe on wet pavement with Yokohama Avid Tour S tires. Now a very nice car!</TEXT>\n",

I fell in love with the redesigned body style of the 2009 model, but that's where the love ends! The biggest complaint I, and many other owners that I have talked to, have with the 2009 Corolla is the Electric Power Steering. I cannot, for the life of me, keep the car in a straight line when traveling over 50mph. I think that it is a design flaw that should get looked into. Other than that rather annoying and potentially unsafe aspect, the build quality is comparable with the 2004 model. Gas mileage is about 35mpg.</TEXT>\n",

The only design flaw is the lack of proper location of arm rests for the drivers seat. This really comes in play on the highway; not as much in the city.

Why? Toyota's reputation for reliability is seldom matched, and competing brands weren't outstanding. It's a solid feeling car that performs as well or better than almost any other economy vehicle. The mileage is superb: with about a half-and-half mix of heavy town traffic and mountain driving, it has averaged 35.8 MPG! Much better than advertised.

I test drove an 08 Toyota Corolla and didn't like it. When I saw the 09 Corolla S, it looked real sharp! The car was smooth riding and looks sporty. This car really turns heads!! In case you're looking at the car colors on toyota.com, the colors online don't do the actual color justice. I was skeptical of the red when I found out that's the car the dealership found for me. But when I saw the car in person, it looked totally different than what that what I saw on Toyota's website. You won't be disappointed.</TEXT>\n",

Our first tank of gas with city driving got 29 mpg. The car is very quiet, handles great and is fun to drive. We were looking for a balance of safety, fuel efficiency and reliability. We tested the Civic, Mazda 3, Hyundai Elantra, and a number of midsized cars. We also liked the Honda Civic but being 6'3\" I felt I had more room in the Corolla. Yes, the electronic steering is a tad sensitive but we got use to it very quickly. With over 30 million Corollas sold world wide, it is now the best selling car in the world.</TEXT>\n",

      "<TEXT>The car is small, but does not feel cramped, at least in the front seat. The back seats are a bit cramped. It would be hard to get 4 full sized adults in the car without some one ending up with a knee in their back. The driver seat is ok, but seriously lacks lumbar support. Finding a place for your elbows while you drive is also difficult. Most of the controls are laid out in a logical manner, and are easy to find. However, the temp gauge, is nearly hidden in the lower right hand corner of the dash display. In an economy car, you expect a plastic dash, but feel of the plastics used in the Corolla are very harsh. The turn signal stalks feel very cheap.</TEXT>\n",

The downside: Although the engine is quiet, there are quite noticeable surges from the transmission even with cruise control on. The surges are very noticeable also in heavy stop and go traffic. My old Buicks had far smoother shifts at far higher mileage. Bumpy roads have too much of an effect on the steering and braking.

It rides smooth, roomy, great horsepower and maintains the road well. I put it on the road a week ago and road noise is not a problem. This is the best car I've ever purchased. It took me two years to make up my mind in what would be my next car and I wouldn't have it no other way. I get compliments and praises everywhere I go. The black on black,  Honda Accord Sedan EX-L V is MY new Lexus!\n",

When you test drive these cars do yourself a favor and take both models out and you'll see what I mean. I bought the Exl version and it's perfect for all the features you get. The car rides beautifully but at the same time you feel the road. I've bought over  cars in my life and I can tell you this car is by far the best of all. \n",

A car is designed to use most of the front brakes to stop, almost % vs % rear. So whats the real problem. Honda's excuse is BULL, (NORMAL) My guess is that the rear emergency brake was never adjusted right from the factory thus inside pad wearing faster than the outside. Either way this is not normal and should be a defect and replaced by the factory. I drive K a year and had to replace the rears at K while the front had / left.

It's bigger than I would have liked it to be but I did not like the styling of the civic, and I thought it was a little smaller than I wanted. Overall not a bad car, but not Honda's best in my opinion having experience with  Accords before. Also the braks wear out prematurely (my back brakes wore out after , miles) only owning the car for  months. Buyer beware the brakes have a design flaw noted in the currant issue of Motor trend.

This car looks awesome from the outside and has decent interior, but Honda needs to go back to a simple engine and have a  speed automatic for fuel economy.

Also, weather has been cold/chilly which also affects it and I probably haven't gotten past the break-in period. Other than that, I love it. XM  month trial is very nice. The sound system and radio are awesome. You have to buy a $ cable for the IPOD to work correctly, but it's awesome. Ride could be a little smoother, but overall is good.\n",

      "The Corolla is a good commuter car that will retain its value and last for years. It's cheap, honest transportation with a few bonuses like standard side impact airbags. The biggest drawback with the ' Corolla is the steering. It's incredibly vague and drifts on the freeway. Looking back, I wish I would have leased the car with a manual transmission. At the time, there weren't that many on the lot. I love Toyotas in general. We also have an ' Camry in the family. Service has been very good at our local dealer. \n",

      "My  Corolla LE has about  miles on it and steers great and handles great. That wasn't always the case. The car used to steer like the front was toed in. The problem issues were that the car was out of alignment in the rear and the Goodyear Eagle tires. The rear axle of an LE is a \"stamped axle\" and has no alignment adjustment. I had to have an alignment shop modify the rear axle bolt position to bring the car into a correct factory assignment. Once that was done the car steers as you would expect and it gained about  miles per gallon in fuel economy. I also replaced the Goodyear Eagle tires which are not safe on wet pavement with Yokohama Avid Tour S tires. Now a very nice car!\n",

I fell in love with the redesigned body style of the  model, but that's where the love ends! The biggest complaint I, and many other owners that I have talked to, have with the  Corolla is the Electric Power Steering. I cannot, for the life of me, keep the car in a straight line when traveling over mph. I think that it is a design flaw that should get looked into. Other than that rather annoying and potentially unsafe aspect, the build quality is comparable with the  model. Gas mileage is about mpg.\n",

The mileage is superb: with about a half-and-half mix of heavy town traffic and mountain driving, it has averaged . MPG! Much better than advertised.

I was disappointed to find, after purchasing this one that these new models don't have the same great handling and steering that I've experienced in the older models. I find, especially when driving on the freeway that the car wanders and I don't feel likr I have a lot of control. I have to grip the steering wheel more intensely, which doesn't bode well for me since I had hoped to be able to use this car for road trips. Aside from steering, the car has met all of my other expectations. It's highly fuel efficient, has a great new look and size and the interior features are easy to manage. \n",

Seat is still not working correctly. Sound system not great. No rear dome light, no glove box light or lock, no lights on visor mirrors. Cloth upholstery is a dirt magnet (unless you buy Toyota's protection package). Wipers don't work when there's frost on the window, until the car warms up. I bought this to replace my gas guzzling Honda mini van. Corolla = about  MPG with mixed freeway and street driving which I consider very good. Wish I'd stuck with Honda. Had looked at the Fit. More bang for the buck.\n",

Ride and handling is good, electric steering requires correct driving form on the hwy (both hands on the wheel) around town its great for parking. We recently took it on a  mile road trip loaded up with  adults and young child very comfortable although the door armrests are annoyingly low.

I have had it in numerous times for repairs - even a team from L.A. could not resolve the problem . Apparently Japan is looking for a \"fix\".

      " The Corolla features a timing chain rather than the usual belt, and has variable valve timing on both camshafts. The mileage is acceptable, although the speedometer reads about  mph fast at  mph. The fuel flow indicator shows . mpg after  total miles, but the actual fuel consumption is . mpg. Adjusted for the previously mentioned speedometer error, that's about an actual  mpg. It has much more power than expected, and the full-time electric power steering is O.K. when I became accustomed to it. I'd buy it again, and the price is right compared with the available competition.\n",

The seats are kind of hard when driving more than  hours and the arm rests are too hard. Now for the reason for the update: This new car, the car that was to be my reliable commuter, is now parked for the winter. After a  hour trip two weeks ago. On the way there there was some heavy rain and wind. The car was nearly uncontrollable! The tires hydroplaned often. On the way back it snowed. The car was blown around and was difficult to drive.

The Corolla only excels in build quality and fuel efficiency.

However, it does come with a price - the gas mileage isn't great at all. Besides, the suspension is a bit too stiff.
